The **Go extension for VS Code** is a powerful tool developed by the Go team at Google that significantly enhances the Go development experience in VS Code.

---

## 🧠 1. IntelliSense & Autocompletion

* Smart code completion for variables, functions, methods, packages, etc.
* Signature help (shows parameter info while typing functions)
* Hover documentation for symbols

---

## 🔎 2. Go to Definition / Peek Definition

* Quickly navigate to the definition of symbols (functions, types, variables)
* Peek definitions inline within your editor

---

## 🛠️ 3. Code Navigation & Refactoring

* Find references
* Rename symbols across your codebase
* Organize imports automatically

---

## 🧪 4. Testing Support

* Run and debug Go unit tests directly from the editor
* Show inline test coverage with the `cover` tool
* Easily run subtests and individual test functions

---

## 🧹 5. Linting & Formatting

* Automatically format code with `gofmt`, `goimports`, or `goreturns`
* Lint code with tools like `golint`, `staticcheck`, or `govet`

---

## 🐞 6. Debugging

* Full debugging support using Delve (`dlv`)
* Set breakpoints, inspect variables, evaluate expressions
* Step in/out/over during debugging sessions

---

## 📦 7. Module & Dependency Management

* Integrated support for `go.mod` and `go.sum` for Go modules
* Automatically detect and install missing dependencies
* Tidy module files and manage versions

---

## 📈 8. Code Snippets

* Common Go constructs (e.g., `for`, `if`, `struct`, etc.) available as snippets
* Ability to create and use custom snippets

---

## 🌐 9. Workspace Features

* Supports multi-root workspaces (useful for monorepos or multi-module projects)
* Environment-aware settings for different projects
