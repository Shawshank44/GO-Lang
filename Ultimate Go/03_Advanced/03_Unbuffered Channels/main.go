		Unbuffered Channels
			Definition: Channels with no capacity (make(chan int)) â€” data is passed only when both sender and receiver are ready.

			Behavior:

			A send operation (ch <- value) will block until another goroutine is ready to receive.

			A receive operation (val := <-ch) will block until another goroutine sends a value.

			Use Case: Useful for synchronization between goroutines.
